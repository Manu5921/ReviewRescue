# Tasks: Review Rescue Chrome Extension

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-review-rescue-a/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included (not requested in specification)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- File paths follow Chrome extension structure defined in plan.md

## Path Conventions
Extension follows Chrome Extension structure:
- `extension/` - Extension source code
  - `popup/` - React UI components
  - `background/` - Service worker scripts
  - `lib/` - Shared utilities and services
  - `content/` - Content scripts
- `config/` - Build configuration
- `tests/` - Test suites (when requested)

- [ ] **T221** Test extension in Chrome (install from dist/, verify all user stories work)
- [ ] **T222** Test extension in Edge browser (verify Chromium compatibility)
- [ ] **T223** Load test with 500+ reviews (verify performance doesn't degrade)
- [ ] **T224** Test offline mode (disconnect internet, verify cached reviews still accessible)
- [ ] **T225** Test with rate-limited Google API (verify fallback to scraping works)
- [ ] **T226** Test with failed AI API (verify error handling, allow manual retry)
- [ ] **T227** Verify all success criteria from spec.md are met (SC-001 through SC-010)

**Checkpoint**: Extension is production-ready ‚úÖ

## Task Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Must complete sequentially)
1. **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T011) ‚Üí Enables all other work
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** (T012-T036) ‚Üí Blocks all user stories
3. **Phase 3: US1** (T037-T068) ‚Üí MVP core, blocks US4
4. **Phase 4: US4** (T069-T089) ‚Üí Independent after US1
5. **Phase 5: US2** (T090-T133) ‚Üí Independent after US1
6. **Phase 6: US3** (T134-T186) ‚Üí Independent after US1
7. **Phase 7: Polish** (T187-T227) ‚Üí Requires all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies
- **US1 (View Reviews)**: No dependencies (after Foundation)
- **US4 (Search/Filter)**: Depends on US1 (needs ReviewList, ReviewCard)
- **US2 (Export)**: Depends on US1 (needs Review data)
- **US3 (Insights)**: Depends on US1 (needs Review data)

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (Foundation)**:
- T012-T013 (Type definitions) [P]
- T033-T034 (UI components, styles) [P]

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T043-T046 (Content script) [P] while doing T037-T042 (API client)
- T062-T066 (Auth UI) [P] while doing T055-T061 (Review list UI)
- T067-T068 (Utilities) [P] with any other US1 task

**Within Phase 5 (US2)**:
- T097-T100 (JSON export) [P] with T090-T096 (CSV export)
- T101-T108 (PDF export) [P] with CSV/JSON tasks
- T120-T122 (Export history) [P] with T123-T133 (Export UI)

**Within Phase 6 (US3)**:
- T148-T150 (Category) [P] with T145-T147 (Sentiment)
- T151-T153 (Pattern) [P] with T154-T156 (Personalized)
- T166-T170 (Statistics) [P] with T139-T144 (Prompts)
- T182-T186 (Cost estimation) [P] with T171-T181 (UI)

**Within Phase 7 (Polish)**:
- Almost all tasks can run in parallel (marked with [P])

### Suggested Parallel Execution Plan

**Sprint 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Day 1-2: Phase 1 Setup (T001-T011)
- Day 3-5: Phase 2 Foundation (T012-T036, many tasks in parallel)

**Sprint 2: MVP Core (Week 2-3)**
- Week 2: Phase 3 US1 Implementation (T037-T068)
  - Parallel stream 1: API + Sync (T037-T054)
  - Parallel stream 2: UI + Auth (T055-T066)
  - Parallel stream 3: Utilities (T067-T068)
- Week 3: MVP testing and refinement

**Sprint 3: Enhanced Features (Week 4-5)**
- Phase 4 US4 Search/Filter (T069-T089) - Week 4
- Phase 5 US2 Export (T090-T133) - Week 5
  - Parallel: CSV, JSON, PDF generators
  - Sequential: Export service, UI

**Sprint 4: Intelligence Layer (Week 6-7)**
- Phase 6 US3 AI Insights (T134-T186) - Week 6-7
  - Parallel: Prompts, parsing, statistics, cost estimation
  - Sequential: AI service, caching, UI

**Sprint 5: Polish & Release (Week 8)**
- Phase 7 Polish (T187-T227)
  - Week 8 Days 1-3: Error handling, performance, settings
  - Week 8 Days 4-5: Testing, documentation, store prep

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 8 weeks (40 days) with 1-2 developers

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Delivery (Minimum Viable Product)
**Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US1 only)
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Deliverable**: Users can authenticate and view all their Google reviews in the extension

**Value**: Solves the core problem (scattered reviews across Google Maps) immediately

### Incremental Delivery Plan

1. **v0.1 (MVP)**: US1 - View Reviews (Week 3)
2. **v0.2**: US1 + US4 - View + Search/Filter (Week 4)
3. **v0.3**: US1 + US4 + US2 - View + Search + Export (Week 5)
4. **v0.4**: US1 + US4 + US2 + US3 - Full Feature Set (Week 7)
5. **v1.0**: v0.4 + Polish (Week 8) - Production Release

### Testing Strategy (If Tests Requested)
Since tests are NOT requested in the spec, testing will be manual:
- **Manual Testing Checklist**: Test each acceptance scenario from spec.md
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Have 3-5 users test each user story independently
- **Performance Testing**: Load test with 500+ reviews, measure metrics against success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010)

**Tasks File Generated**: 2025-10-08
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 (Setup) - T001
**Recommended MVP**: Complete through Phase 3 (US1) first, then iterate with US4, US2, US3
