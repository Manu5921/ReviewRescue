# Specification Quality Checklist: Review Rescue Chrome Extension

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:
- Specification is written in business-focused language without technical implementation details
- Focuses on user value and measurable business outcomes
- Accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- All 18 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous
- No clarification markers present - all requirements use informed defaults based on industry standards
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not implementation)
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (9 scenarios covering authentication, data handling, performance)
- Scope clearly bounded with explicit In Scope and Out of Scope sections
- Dependencies and assumptions documented thoroughly

**Feature Readiness**:
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with independent test paths
- Each user story includes clear acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- Success criteria define 10 measurable outcomes aligned with user value
- Specification maintains focus on "what" and "why" without leaking into "how"

## Recommendations

The specification is ready for the next phase. Recommended next steps:

1. **Option A - Direct to Planning**: Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. **Option B - Further Clarification**: Run `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholders want to explore edge cases or refine requirements

## Notes

- Specification assumes Google provides accessible review data APIs (documented in Assumptions)
- Performance targets optimized for 10-200 review range (most common user segment)
- AI insights implementation approach left flexible (local or external service)
- Export formats chosen based on common user needs (CSV for data, JSON for developers, PDF for printable records)
